    <h1>A regret of this generation</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        We are going to highlight a lot of inequality in the world. With the poor access to water and food in the world.
    </p>
    <p> 
        My main regrets are the food inequalities in the world and the access to clean water.  
    </p>
    <h3>The numbers that make you think ...</h3>
    <p>
        There are a huge number of undernourished people on the globe, almost a billion! The affected populations 
        are in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. In Asia, about 500 million people are affected, in 
        Africa about 230 million. While in Latin America and the Caribbean there are 45 million people suffering 
        from malnutrition. Then there are other people who are affected but they are few in number in their countries. 
        In Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, 1.7 million children are severely malnourished.

    <h3>The crisis has not helped</h3>
    <p>
        The Covid 19 crisis has only increased the number of people with poor access to food resources. 
        But drinkable water resources are for some a luxury, or they do not have easy access to them as we do, 
        for example with taps. 
    </p>
    <h3>Poor access to nutrition and wastage of Europeans</h3>
    <p>
        They do not have abundant water, it is even difficult to get a well in the villages. And undernourishment is 
        also linked to the consumption of undrinkable water or water of poor quality. Because of this, there are more 
        and more diseases and contagions linked to unsafe or poor quality water. While in developed countries, there 
        is an unconscionable overconsumption of water. These countries waste titanic amounts of water when many 
        countries need it mainly for drinking. Their hygiene is only secondary, but we consume more than we need. 
        I think we need to distribute all the food resources we don't consume to the poorest countries. Then stop 
        wasting all the water we use and try to transfer water to the countries that need it most. Trying to find 
        strategies to do this.
