    <h1>A great hope for the world</h1>

    <p>
        We are going to enumerate a lot of systems to help the poor. In particular with the associations or even the kitty.
    </p>
    <p> 
        We will see how people help the poorest. 
    </p>
    <h3>How to help ?</h3>
    <p>
        People who help the most disadvantaged such as use kitty campaigns or associations. In France, 
        there is notably the Restos du cœur founded by Coluche, from 1985. 
    </p>
    <h3>Who was he ?</h3>
    <p>
        Coluche was a comedian and humorist, born in Paris. His speeches were very provocative, especially socially
        speaking. In 1981, he announced that he was running for president but quickly withdrew. All this because of 
        threats and pressure.

        the picture.
    </p>
    <h3>What finish ?</h3>
    <p>
        And so, in 1985, he founded his association, which helps the poorest people and those in need. He was already
        involved in the fight against famine in Ethiopia and food waste, just to name a few social commitments. 
        This association has distributed from 1985 to today, more than 2.3 billion meals. It also allows many people 
        to help them, for example, by providing emergency accommodation for people in very precarious situations, 
        by accompanying them in their search for employment and by providing other more or less important assistance. 
        Coluche died in 1986, very quickly after the creation of his association, but this association has become a 
        monument in France.

    <h3>Other types of aid ?</h3>
    <p>
        There are also kitchens which are a way to help people in precarious situations. But there are frauds concerning 
        the kitchens, and therefore the government begins to study the security of these kitchens which are for the most 
        part on line. But all that happens internally in the associations and the kitty, we do not have the certainty 
        that our contribution will be used to help people, that is why the different States are informed to create laws 
        concerning that. There are also videos to discover the functioning of several associations, such as Michou's 
        informative video on the association Action Against Hunger. I think it's normal that people get informed to see 
        how their money can be transformed to help people in need and those in extreme need.
