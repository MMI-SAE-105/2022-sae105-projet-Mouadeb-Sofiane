    <h1>The Series that sums it all up</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        We will see what Oda is up to in his work. He makes a lot of hidden 
        allusions which makes his style intriguing and interesting.
    </p>

    <p>One Piece logo</p>
    <p>
        One Piece was chosen because of the lack of access to the same resources and also the ecological
        problems on Wano. There is racism on the island of the fish men and on the island of Sabaody.
    </p>
    <h3>Our harmful way of life</h3>
    <p>
        In the anime One Piece, we can see a lot of allusions to our way of consumption, that's what 
        we'll see today. The producer is Eiichirō Oda, he is also the manga's mangaka. We can see in 
        particular in the arc Wano Kuni, quite a lot of denunciation concerning our way of life and 
        how it could perhaps end. 
    </p>
    <h3>Scenario close to reality</h3>
    <p>
        In this arc, there is a lot of inequality because a pirate has invaded the country and he controls 
        everything, including the arms trade, access to food and water. In the land of the Wa, the arms trade
        monopolises a lot of the country's economy but is done in a safe place so that the population doesn't 
        suspect anything. The pirate named Kaido, tries to create an authoritarian regime (he seeks the obedience
        of the population).
    </p>
    <h3>Let's come to inequalities and pollution</h3>
    <p>
        In this country, the capital is the centre of food resources and access to drinking water. 
        All the people living in the other cities do not have access to the same resources as those in the capital. 
        They do not have access to food and clean water. The other villages take all the food waste from the Flower 
        Capital. Kaido has badly industrialised the country because the opponents work there, so they are slaves. 
        The pollution of air, water, land and food is quickly set up. This is why there are huge inequalities in the
        country and especially in all the villages. Agriculture is complex in the country because the land is 
        polluted so it is impossible to plant. The villages eat fish that live in polluted waters and therefore 
        the population suffers a lot of illness due to the bacteria in the food and water.  
    </p>

    <h3>The defence of other interests</h3>
    <p>
        In this series, Oda defends many things. He alludes to racism with the fish men who are discriminated 
        against because of their different skins which is located at the arc of the fish men's island and also 
        on the Sadonby island. On Sabaody Island, one can see privileged people who are the celestial dragons. 
        They use the fishmen as slaves, and even no human should raise his hand or speak badly to a celestial 
        dragon or he will be killed on the spot.

    <h3>To conclude</h3>
    <p>
        We can see that Eiichirō Oda hates pollution and he is for ecology. This coincides with my book on pollution. 
        Oda is against the access of unequal distribution of food resources. There are many ecological problems.

    <h3>We will now look at the filmography of Eiichirō Oda</h3>
    <p>
        Eiichirō Oda, has only made One Piece during his career which continues because the series is not finished. 
        He won't release anything after One Piece, according to him because he dedicates all his life and it's been 
        more than 23 years that he publishes every week 1 episode. But he has published films and here they are.
