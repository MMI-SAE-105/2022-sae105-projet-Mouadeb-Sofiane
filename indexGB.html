            Here are the different articles which all coincide on one and the same theme, the distresses of the 
            present world. 
            We will use different types of content on this theme. There will be an article against a music, 
            a book, a place, a series, a regret and finally a hope.
        </p>


    <h2>An interesting music</h2>

            by money and consumption. Perhaps we can even talk about mass consumption.
